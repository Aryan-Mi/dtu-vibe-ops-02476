# Hydra Defaults - Specifies which config files to load from config groups
defaults:
  - model: baseline_cnn      # loads configs/model/baseline_cnn.yaml
  - _self_                   # keeps overrides from this file

# Training Configuration
training:
  max_epochs: 20
  patience: 7                # Early stopping patience
  accelerator: "auto"        # auto, gpu, cpu, mps
  devices: "auto"

# Data Configuration
data:
  data_path: "data/raw/ham10000"
  num_classes: 7             # HAM10000 has 7 classes
  image_size: 240            # Updated to match EfficientNet-B1 model (was 224 for B0)
  batch_size: 32
  num_workers: 4
  # Subsampling (optional) - set to null to use full dataset
  subsample_percentage: null  # e.g., 0.1 for 10% of data
  subsample_seed: 42

wandb:
  enabled: true
  project: "skin-lesion-classification"
  run_name: null  # auto-generated if not set
  log_model: true

# Paths
paths:
  output_dir: "models"  # Changed to match models.dvc tracking
  log_dir: "logs"
  # Models are now tracked with DVC and pushed to gs://vibeops-models
  # Direct GCS upload is disabled - use DVC for model versioning

# Reproducibility
